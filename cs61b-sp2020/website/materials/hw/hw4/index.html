<h2 id="a-introduction">A. Introduction</h2>


<p>In this homework, you'll learn some things that we won't talk about in
lecture: classes and methods dedicated to searching strings for
selected patterns and for reading formatted input.</p>

<p>Warning: There's a lot of jargon for this homework. Sorry! Focus on
the experiments and writing code and it should all come together. We always suggest you read the spec, but you will be more confused than normal if you skip this reading!</p>

<p>As usual, you can obtain the skeleton with</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch shared
$ git merge shared/hw4
$ git push</code></pre>

<p>and submit it by adding and committing all work, tagging, pushing, and pushing tags.</p>


<h2 id="b-scanners">B. Scanners</h2>



<h3 id="intro-to-scanners">Intro to Scanners</h3>

<p>If you're already familiar with scanners,
you can skip straight to the tasks below.</p>

<p>The class <code>java.util.Scanner</code> gives you a way to read
substrings of text, also called <strong><em>tokens</em></strong>, sequentially
from a stream of text that is furnished to the <code>Scanner</code> by its
constructor.  Typically, the stream of text comes from a file or from
a terminal, but there are ways to convert any source of characters
into a stream that a <code>Scanner</code> can process.</p>

<p>One of Scanner's constructors accepts an <code>InputStream</code>--a
stream of bytes (8-bit characters). Since <code>System.in</code>, which is
normally the <strong><em>standard input</em></strong> stream to your program, is a
kind of <code>InputStream</code> (that is, its type is a subtype of
<code>InputStream</code>), you can write</p>

<pre><code>java.util.Scanner inp = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);</code></pre>

<p>to get something that scans the input from your terminal.  (Normally,
of course, you'd put <code>import java.util.Scanner;</code> at the
beginning of your source file and just write <code>Scanner</code> instead
of <code>java.util.Scanner</code>).</p>

<p>One can also create Scanners from Strings (e.g. <code>Scanner s = new
Scanner(&quot;hello&quot;);</code>), input files, and more.</p>

<p>The simplest way to use a <code>Scanner</code> is to treat the input stream
as a sequence of tokens separated by text that matches a
<strong><em>delimiter pattern</em></strong>.  By default, the delimiter pattern
matches stretches of whitespace (blanks, tabs, newlines, carriage
returns). For example, consider the input below:</p>

<pre><code>hello i am a half human half

horse</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the tokens separated by our delimiter pattern are
<code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;i&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;am&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;a&quot;</code>,
<code>&quot;half&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;human&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;half&quot;</code>, and
<code>&quot;horse&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Delimiter patterns can be arbitrary. For example, if our delimiter
pattern were stretches of ";" and "," characters then the string:</p>

<pre>hello; i am just a, horse</pre>

<p>Would yield the tokens <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>, <code>&quot; i am just a&quot;</code>, and
<code>&quot; horse&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Look at <code>ReadInts.java</code> and <code>TestReadInts.java</code>. <code>ReadInts</code> provides one
complete method <code>printInts</code> and two incomplete methods
<code>readInts</code> and <code>smartReadInts</code>. <code>TestReadInts</code>
calls all three methods, testing as appropriate.</p>


<h3 id="experiment-1-testreadints">Experiment #1: TestReadInts</h3>


<p>Try running <code>TestReadInts</code>. You should see that <code>testReadInts</code> and
<code>testSmartReadInts</code> fail, but <code>testPrintInts</code> will print out the
contents of the input <code>String inp</code> as you would expect. Yay, the
provided code works.</p>

<p>Next take a look at <code>ReadInts.java</code> and look at the source of the <code>printInts</code>
method. You'll see that it uses the <code>hasNext()</code> and <code>nextInt()</code> methods from
the <code>Scanner s</code> object created.</p>

<p>These methods, along with their most common brethren are described
below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>s.hasNext()</code> is true if and only if (iff) there is another token (that
  is, something other than a delimiter) before the end of the input.</li>
  <li><code>s.next()</code> returns the next token, and advances
  <code>s</code> past it.</li>
  <li><code>s.hasNextInt()</code> is true iff <code>s.hasNext()</code>
  and the next token has the syntax of a (possibly signed) decimal
  numeral.</li>
  <li><code>s.nextInt()</code> does an <code>s.next()</code> and then
  parses the token into an <code>int</code>.</li>
  <li>There are several other similarly named methods for other types such as
  <code>s.hasNextDouble()</code>, which returns true if there is another double available
  to be read and <code>s.nextDouble()</code> which returns a <code>double</code> parsed from a
  call to <code>s.next()</code>.</li>
  <li><code>s.hasNextInt(RADIX)</code> is true iff the next token
  exists and has the syntax of a (possibly signed) base-RADIX numeral, where RADIX is an int. For example 
  this could be used to check for integers that are binary (RADIX = 2) or 
  hexadecimal (RADIX = 16).</li>
  <li><code>s.nextInt(RADIX)</code> reads the next token as a base-RADIX numeral, throwing an
  exception if there is no next token, or it does not have the right form for
  a numeral with that radix.</li>
  <li><code>s.hasNextLine()</code> is true iff there is any more input.</li>
  <li><code>s.nextLine()</code> returns the next line of input (that is,
  everything up to, but not including, the next end-of-line character,
  or the end of the input if there isn't an end-of-line at the end). Note that unix convention expects all text files to end in a new line character.
  It then positions <code>inp</code> past the end-of-line character.  Thus,
  it differs from the other <code>next</code> methods in that it uses a
  different delimiter (end of line instead of whitespace).</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="programming-tasks">Programming Tasks</h3>



<h4 id="task-1-readints">Task 1: readInts()</h4>


<p>As above, when you run <code>TestReadInts</code>, you'll see that your code fails
in <code>readInts</code>.  Head to the <code>readInts</code> method, and you'll see that one
line of code is missing.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">documentation</a> for the <code>ArrayList</code> class,
figure out how to modify the code so that the <code>readInts</code> method works
correctly.</p>

<p>The <code>testReadInts</code> test feeds your method a bad input, and actually expects an 
exception. For those of you who are particularly keen on the idea of testing
exceptions, JUnit supports a less unwieldy syntax based on the <code>@Rule</code> tag, which 
you're free to use.</p>


<h4 id="task-2-smartreadints">Task 2: smartReadInts()</h4>


<p>Complete the <code>smartReadInts</code> method so that it works as described in the
comments and <code>TestReadInts</code>. Use the <code>readInts</code> method as a guide.</p>


<h2 id="c-patterns">C. Patterns</h2>


<p>Your code in the previous part looked through input token by token,
accepting tokens that were integers. How does Java know if a string
represents an integer? As you might imagine, it looks for sequences
that contain only the digits 0-9, possibly preceded by a <code>&#x2d;</code> symbol.</p>

<p>What if we want to match, for example, numerals that only contain
digits less than 5? Or five-digit numerals only?</p>

<p>Java provides a faculty for this known as <em>Pattern Matching</em>, and
supports a rich syntax for specifying patterns. For example, one-digit numerals
less than 5 could be expressed by the pattern "[01234]". Five-digit
numberals could be expressed by <code>&quot;[0&#x2d;9][0&#x2d;9][0&#x2d;9][0&#x2d;9][0&#x2d;9]&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;[0&#x2d;9]{5}&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>These patterns are sometimes referred to as <em>regular expressions</em> (sometimes referred to as RegEx),
though strictly speaking, they're more general than the
formal notion of a regular expression that might be discussed, for
example, in an upper-division CS class in your future.</p>

<p>The full pattern language is quite rich, and is documented under 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">java.util.regex.Pattern</a>
in the on-line Java library documentation.  Here are just a few constructs that
you might find particularly useful. You are not expected to read this
entire list for this homework. However, you may find it useful moving
forward in 61B.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most characters (letters, digits, most punctuation) simply match
  themselves.</li>
  <li>A period (".") acts as a wildcard and matches any character other
  than (usually) newline.  To get "." to match newline as well, include
  <code>(?s)</code> at the beginning of your pattern.</li>
  <li>A sequence such as "[abe]" denotes a <em>character
  class</em>: in this case, "any of the (single) characters
  <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>e</code>".  As a shorthand, you can
  represent a range of characters with a hyphen, as in <code>&quot;[abd&#x2d;qs&#x2d;z]&quot;</code> to
  mean <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>d</code> through <code>q</code>, and <code>s</code>
  through <code>z</code>.</li>
  <li>A character class beginning with a carat, such as <code>[^abe]</code>, 
  matches any single character <em>other than</em> those listed (the compliment).</li>
  <li>There are several useful two-character shorthands for certain
  character classes.  <code>\d</code> is short for <code>[0&#x2d;9]</code>,
  <code>\s</code> is short for <code>[ \t\n\r]</code> (that is, for whitespace).
  Unfortunately, in order to put an actual <code>\</code> in a string in Java, you
  must double it.  Thus, a pattern that matches any two-digit string
  would be written as the string literal <code>&quot;\\d\\d&quot;</code>.
  (The Python language got around this problem with "raw strings" such
  as <code>r&quot;\s&quot;</code>, and Perl got around it by having patterns be a part of
  the syntax, distinct from strings.  The Java designers, however, apparently
  never saw the need.)</li>
  <li>If <code>P</code> represents a pattern, then <code>P*</code> represents
  "0 or more repetitions of P".  Thus, <code>x*</code> matches the empty
  string, "x", "xx", "xxx", etc.  <code>[a&#x2d;c]*</code> matches "", "a", "ab",
  "aa", "bac", "ccc", etc.  <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>?</code> (see below) have
  the strongest binding of any
  character.  That is, <code>ab*</code> means "one
  <code>a</code> followed by 0 or more <code>b</code>s".  To get the effect
  of "0 or more
  <code>ab</code>s", use <code>(ab)*</code></li>
  <li>Similarly, P+ means "1 or more Ps."</li>
  <li><code>P?</code> denotes an optional P (0 or 1 Ps).</li>
  <li>If <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> denote patterns, then <code>P|Q</code>
  denotes "a <code>P</code> or a <code>Q</code>".
  For example the pattern <code>a|b</code> will match either "a" or "b".</li>
  <li><code>(P)</code> denotes the same thing as P. It also serves to
  define a <em>group</em>, a subpattern whose match you can
  retrieve later.</li>
  <li><code>(?:P)</code> also denotes the same thing as <code>P</code>, but it does not
  define a group that you can retrieve later.</li>
  <li>Following a <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, or <code>?</code> with a <code>?</code> creates a "non-greedy" version,
  meaning that it matches as few characters as possible to make the match work.
  This affects <em>what</em> part of a string gets matched, but usually not <em>whether</em>
  a string gets matched. For example, if you are matching the string
  "1, 2, 3, 4" against the pattern string <code>&quot;(\\d).*(\\d).*&quot;</code>, the first
  group will match <code>1</code> and second will match <code>4</code>.  But with the pattern
  string <code>&quot;(\\d).*?(\\d).*&quot;</code>, the second group will match <code>2</code>.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Boundary matchers</em></strong> match the empty string, but only
  at certain places.  <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> match the beginning and
  end of a string, respectively (but see below).  <code>\G</code> matches
  the point at which the last match ended (this makes sense only in
  <code>Scanners</code>, <code>Matchers</code>, or other kinds of things that have a notion of
  "the last thing that was matched").  <code>\b</code> matches a "word
  boundary", a place where a word begins or ends. (Again, when coding the
  pattern as a Java <code>String</code> literal, you must write <code>\\b</code>.)</li>
  <li>The sequence <code>(?m)</code> always matches the empty string, but
  has a side effect of causing <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> to match the
  beginnings and ends of lines as well as of entire strings.</li>
  <li>The two-character escape sequences <code>\?</code>, <code>\*</code>,
  <code>\.</code>, <code>\+</code>, etc., match the character after the
  backslash, ignoring their special significance.  Thus, the pattern
  <code>who\?</code> matches the string "who?", and would be written in a
  Java program as the string literal <code>&quot;who\\?&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="experiment-2-matching">Experiment #2: Matching</h3>


<p>Compile and run the <code>Matching</code> class. This class allows you to
type in strings and patterns and see if the entire string matches the
pattern. If you include any groups (read ahead if you're
curious), it will also print those.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ java Matching
  Alternately type strings to match and patterns to match against
  them. Use \ at the end of line to enter multi&#x2d;line strings or
  patterns (\s are removed, leaving newlines).  The program
  will indicate whether each pattern matches the ENTIRE
  preceding string.  Enter QUIT to end the program.
String: 123456
Pattern: [0&#x2d;9]{6}
Matches.
String: 123456
Pattern: [0&#x2d;9]{5}
No match.
String: 12345
Pattern: [0&#x2d;9]{6}
No match.
String: abdeffff
Pattern: ab(c|de)f+
Matches.
  Group 1: &#x27;de&#x27;
String: abbbbdefefgg*h
Pattern: a(b+)d(ef)+gg\*h
Matches.
  Group 1: &#x27;bbbb&#x27;
  Group 2: &#x27;ef&#x27;
String: QUIT</code></pre>

<p>Use this class to experiment with how patterns work. Try writing
patterns that match the following. Sample answers are given for each
problem (drag the mouse over the white area after "Answer:" to see it).</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single digit between 5 and 8. Answer: <font color="FFFFFF">[5-8].</font></li>
  <li>Sequences of lower case letters. Answer: <font color="FFFFFF">[a-z]+</font></li>
  <li>Sequences of lower case letters except the letter j. Answer: 
  <font color="FFFFFF">[a-ik-z]+</font></li>
  <li>Sequences of characters that start with the uppercase letter A and
  end with the letter f. Answer: <font color="FFFFFF">A.*f</font></li>
  <li>Sequences of three words separated by spaces, where a word is
  defined as a sequence of lower case letters. Answer:
  <font color="FFFFFF">[a-z]+ +[a-z]+ +[a-z]+</font></li>
  <li>Sequences of three
  words separated by spaces, and where group 1 corresponds to the second
  word. Answer: <font color="FFFFFF">[a-z]+ +([a-z]+) +[a-z]+</font></li>
</ul>

<p>To get more practice with writing regular expressions check out
<a href="https://regexr.com/">RegExr</a> or <a href="https://regex101.com/">regular expressions 101</a>.
These sites use plain regular expressions rather than Java patterns, which
differ slightly as we have discussed above. They are still a great way
to build more familiarity with regular expressions, which as we have
mentioned, have many different applications involving string matching
across multiple different programming languages.</p>


<h3 id="programming-task">Programming task</h3>


<p>In <code>P2Pattern.java</code>, you are given 5 String variables named <code>P1</code>, <code>P2</code>, <code>P3</code>, <code>P4</code> and <code>P5</code>. You are supposed to write regular expression as per the directions. Don't forget to use the escape character twice (<code>\\</code>) wherever you need a backslash (<code>\</code>) in regular expression.</p>

<p><strong>1. For P1:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Define a pattern that matches valid dates of the form MM/DD/YYYY</li>
  <li>For example, <code>12/25/2019</code> is a valid date but <code>25/12/2019</code> is not.</li>
  <li>Assume that MM ranges from 01-12, DD ranges from 01-31 and YYYY ranges from 1900 onwards.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. For P2:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Define a pattern that matches lists of non-negative numerals in the notation we used in homework
  2 (e.g. <code>(1, 2, 33, 1, 63)</code>).</li>
  <li>Each numeral but the last should be followed by a comma and one or more spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. For P3:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Define a pattern that matches a valid domain name.</li>
  <li>For example, <code>www.support.ucb&#x2d;login.com</code> is a valid domain name (even if it doesn't really exist!)</li>
  <li>A valid domain name contains set of alphanumeric characters (i.e., a-z, A-Z), numbers (i.e. 0-9) and dashes (-) or a combination of all of these.</li>
  <li>It does not begin or end with dash (-) or period (.)</li>
  <li>It does not contain whitespace ( ) or underscore (_)</li>
  <li>Assume that the top-level domain (last part after period) is between 2 to 6 characters in length.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. For P4:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Define a pattern that matches a valid Java variable name</li>
  <li>For example, <code>_myVariable$1</code> is a valid variable name in Java while <code>1stVariable</code> is not.</li>
  <li>A variable name cannot start with an integer. It can consist of alphanumeric characters as well as <code>_</code> and <code>$</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. For P5:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Define a pattern that matches valid IPv4 address.</li>
  <li>For example, <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a valid IP address whereas <code>299.10.10.1</code> is not.</li>
  <li>A valid IPv4 address consists of four positive integer parts separated by period (.). Each integer part can range from 0-255.</li>
</ul>

<p>Run <code>TestP2Pattern.java</code> to verify that your patterns are correct.</p>
