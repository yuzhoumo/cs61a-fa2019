<h2 id="a-set-of-strings">A. Set of Strings</h2>


<p>Complete the implementation of the type <code>BSTStringSet</code>, which implements the
interface <code>StringSet</code>.  As the class name suggests, the intended implementation
uses a binary search tree.  Don't use any of the Java Collection classes in your
BST implementation (you may still use a <code>List</code> implementation to collect items for
the <code>asList</code> method).</p>

<p>Hint: think about what you would like your functions to be taking in, returning, and computing. Remember that you can always make your own private helper functions.</p>


<h2 id="b-bststringset-bounded-iterator">B. BSTStringSet Bounded Iterator</h2>


<p>Modify <code>BSTStringSet</code> to implement <code>SortedStringSet</code>, providing an iterator that returns elements 
within a specified range of values in ascending order.  The iterator should produce 
its <em>M</em> values in time <em>O(M + h)</em>, where <em>h</em> is the height of the tree, as described in lecture. 
We've provided the class <code>BSTStringSetRangeTest</code> to help check that your solution works in these time bounds.</p>

<p>The tricky part of this assignment is producing an inorder tree iterator.
We've provided the class BSTIterator, which is an iterator for a full BST. You can reference this class when writing the in-order iterator.</p>


<h2 id="c-echashstringset">C. ECHashStringSet</h2>


<p>For this problem, you'll expand on your work from earlier by creating a
hashing-based implementation of the <code>StringSet</code> interface.</p>

<p>To implement the interface, you'll be working almost completely
from scratch, with only minimal skeleton code that implements the interface so the code will compile.
This one will be a fair bit more difficult than the <code>BSTStringSet</code>.</p>

<p>Create a class <code>ECHashStringSet</code> (EC as in <em>External Chaining</em>) that implements the <code>StringSet</code> interface
using an external chaining hash table as its core data structure. In
order to ensure that the <code>.put</code> and <code>.contains</code> operations are fast, you should
resize the hash table as soon as the load factor exceeds 5. For memory
efficiency, we ideally would ensure that the load factor is never less than
0.2, except for empty lists, for which the load factor is allowed to
be zero.
Why would this have an important effect on our memory useage?
 However, for this assignment, you do not need to worry about this behavior or downsizing the set since we
do not have a remove operation. You also do not need to worry about <code>asList</code> returning the keys in sorted order.</p>

<p>There is one annoying issue you'll enounter: If the <code>hashCode()</code> is
negative, we need to remove the top bit (since negative array indices
are not allowed in Java). You can do this using the bit operations we
discussed earlier in class, e.g. <code>s.hashCode() &amp; 0x7fffffff) %
bucketCount</code>. You should remember this from BitExercise.absolute(int x) in HW5.</p>

<p>There's no restriction on what you are allowed to use, but you should
avoid using any library class that has "hash"
in the name, since that would defeat the whole point of this problem.
You <strong>are</strong> allowed to use the <code>hashCode()</code> function for Strings.</p>

<p>For an extra challenge, don't use anything that requires using a Java library
class (except for the <code>asList</code> method).</p>

  standard Java library.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining_with_linked_lists">Wikipedia article on separate chaining</a>&nbsp;(another term for external chaining).</li>
  <li>If you are getting "unchecked or unsafe operations" errors, you might want to
  look at this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/217065/cannot-create-an-array-of-linkedlists-in-java">Stack Overflow post</a> on creating arrays of objects that
  expect a formal type parameter. There is no good way to avoid the
  warning, aside from suppressing it. If you are curious why, check out this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1129795/what-is-suppresswarnings-unchecked-in-java">Stack Overflow post</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your correctness tests from the previous part should work almost without
modification (you'll just need to change the type of object that is
instantiated). Make sure to test something that inserts a large number
of strings. One testing approach is to generate random strings, insert
them into both your <code>ECHashStringSet</code> and a
<code>TreeSet&lt;String&gt;</code>, then iterate through the entire
TreeSet and ensure that all of its members are also contained in your
ECHashStringSet and vice-versa.</p>

<p>One solution from a previous semester
(which does use an import for handling the list of items
that go in each bucket) is 66 lines including comments and whitespace.</p>

<p>If you're unsure how to get started, slide 4 from the <a href="../../lectures/lect24.pdf">Hashing</a> lecture provides a visual of what our hash table will look like. Starting from this visual, try asking yourself:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What data structure do I need to make my buckets? What about the list stored at each bucket?</li>
  <li>How do I know which bucket a given <code>String</code> should be put in?</li>
  <li>Try implementing <code>put</code> and <code>contains</code>. Test that you are able to add to your <code>ECHashStringSet</code> and check if it contains elements.</li>
  <li>Now, aim to satisfy the efficiency requirement with resizing. When do we want to resize the array? How do I resize an array?</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="d-echashstringset-timing">D. ECHashStringSet Timing</h2>


<p>Run the provided timing tests <code>InsertRandomSpeedTest</code> and <code>InsertInOrderSpeedTest</code> for a range of speeds. Fill out <code>hw6timing.txt</code> as directed. Note that <code>hw6timing.txt</code> has the input sizes you should be passing to <code>InsertRandomSpeedTest</code> and <code>InsertInOrderSpeedTest.</code></p>

<p>If you're having timing issues, make sure your hash table is actually resizing. However, give it a minute to run. The staff solution still takes about 60 seconds to compute some of the largest tests.</p>


<h2 id="e-amortized-runtime">E. Amortized Runtime</h2>


<p>So now you've implemented your HashSet (or at least read the spec) and (hopefully) satisfied the runtime constraints. We have seen other data structures in this class which rarely have such good runtime. 
How can we store so many elements efficiently with such good runtime? 
How do our decisions about when and how to resize affect this?</p>

<p>For an intuitive metaphor for this, check out <a href="https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap8/chap84.html">Amortized Analysis (Grigometh's Urn)</a>.</p>

<p>If you are more visually inclined, visualize the runtime in a graph. When we first create our HashSet, let's say we decide to start with an outer array of size 4. This means we can have constant runtime for our first four insertions. Each operation will only take one unit of time.
<center>
<img src="firstInsert.png" alt="">
</center></p>

<p>When we reach our load factor and have to resize, let's say we decide to make an array of size 8 and copy over our four current items-- which takes four constant time lookups.
<center>
<img src="make4.png" alt="">
</center></p>

<p>That is a big spike! How can we say this is constant? Well, we will now have eight fast inserts! Wow!
<center>
<img src="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/materials/hw/hw6/8inserts.png" alt="">
</center></p>

<p>A pattern starts to emerge. Once we have again reached our load factor there will be a spike, followed by a sequence of "inexpensive" inserts. These spikes, however, are growing rapidly!
<center>
<img src="resizeTo8.png" alt="">
</center></p>

<p>If we imagine this continuing, each spike will get bigger and bigger! Perhaps counterintuitively, this runtime, viewed over a long time, is actually constant if the work is "amortized" over all of our inserts. Here amortized means that we are spreading the cost of an expensive operation over all our operations. This gives us a constant runtime overall for a large sequence of inserts and resizes. To convince yourself of this visually, imagine "tipping" the size four spike so that it adds one operation to each of the four fast inserts before it. Now each insert operation is taking about 2 units of work, which is constant! We can see this pattern will continue. We can "tip" our size eight resize across the eight previous fast operations! Try drawing a few more resizes out and convince yourself that the spike will always fit.</p>

<p>We have now gotten to the heart of the efficacy of HashSets. 
Would we get this behavior if we picked a resizing scheme which was additive and not multiplicative?</p>
