<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>
  Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first. Each move
  consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally, vertically, or
  diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing
  piece, which is then removed from the board. A piece may jump over friendly
  pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross enemy pieces, except one
  that it captures. A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal
  to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it
  chooses to move (the line of action). This line contains both the squares
  behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the piece
  is on. A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color,
  or over an opposing piece.
</p>

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>

<p>
  To move a piece, click on the piece and then click on the square to which
  you wish to move it.
</p>

<p>
  The Settings menu allows you to choose which side(s) are played by automated
  players, and to set a random seed that provides any random factor that the
  automated players may choose to use (so that they play identically when given
  the same seed).
