     <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>


<p>The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular
emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.</p>

<ol>
  <li>CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to
  think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level
  operations dictated by the computer hardware.</li>
  <li>CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such
  as constructing and analyzing large programs.</li>
  <li>CS 61C focuses on machines and how they execute programs.</li>
</ol>

<p>In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how
to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques
for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data
abstraction, and object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular
language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to
the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source
language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the
diversity of its contributors. We will also use two other languages in the
latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured
Query Language (SQL).</p>

<p>Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of CS
61A. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in your future
endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the concepts involved
in programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but
a few days' work.</p>

<p>A complete list of lecture topics, readings, and assignments appears in the
<a href="../index.html">daily schedule</a>.</p>


<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>


<p>Math 1A is listed as a corequisite for CS 61A. (That is, it may be taken
concurrently.) Math 10A or Math 16A are also fine. It is possible to take CS 61A
without knowing or learning calculus; all of the old calculus-based examples
have been removed over the years. However, taking calculus is a great way to
brush up on the arithmetic and algebra that appear regularly in CS 61A.</p>

<p>There are no formal programming-related prerequisites for CS 61A, but it's not
the right first course for all students. Many CS 61A students have had
significant prior programming experience, including prior coursework. Some
students take the course without any prior programming experience, but they
typically must work substantially harder to master the material, perhaps simply
because they have less practice working with programs. If you have limited prior
experience and you find it challenging to complete all of the required
coursework in the first three weeks, you should seriously consider taking
another course first. You'll likely have a better experience taking 61A later,
and you won't fall behind in any meaningful way by taking one of the
alternatives below prior to taking 61A.</p>


<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>


<p>If you want to build programming experience before taking CS 61A, we recommend
that you take one of these courses first. You can always take CS 61A in a future
semester.</p>


<h4 id="cs-10">CS 10</h4>


<p><a href="http://cs10.org">CS 10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing</a> provides a bird's-eye
view of the field of computer science. The course teaches students how to
program using Snap (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming
languages ever invented, as well as Python, the same language used in 61A. But
the course is far more than just learning to program! You'll also learn about
some big ideas of computing, such as abstraction, design, recursion,
concurrency, simulations, and the limits of computation. You'll see beautiful
applications of computing that have changed the world, as well as talk about the
history of computing and where it will go in the future.</p>


<h4 id="data-8">Data 8</h4>


<p><a href="http://data8.org/">Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science</a> is an introduction
to data science designed to be accessible and useful for all Berkeley students.
This course was built for students without prior programming experience.  It
teaches students to program in Python 3, but covers a much smaller subset of the
language than CS 61A. Most of the course focuses on data processing and
statistical techniques that are central to using computers to answer questions
about the world. The overlap between Data 8 and CS 61A is small (perhaps 25%),
but the programming skill you will acquire in Data 8 will help you maintain the
faster pace of CS 61A.</p>


<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>


<p>The course includes many events and opportunities for learning: lecture, lab,
discussion, office hours, guerrilla sections, and group mentoring. We understand
that everyone learns differently, so not all of these events are required.
However, it is recommended that you try everything out to figure out what
combination of these events works best for you.</p>


<h3 id="lecture">Lecture</h3>


<p>There are three 50-minute lectures per week. Slides and videos will be posted
before each lecture. A screencast of the live lecture will be posted soon after
each lecture occurs. This course moves fast, and lecture is tightly coordinated
with section. Please attend or watch each lecture the day it is given and before
you attend section.</p>


<h3 id="section">Section</h3>


<p>There are two sections each week: one lab and one discussion. These sections are
run by an amazing group of teaching assistants who have been carefully selected
for their ability, enthusiasm, and dedication to learning. Getting to know your
TA is an excellent way to succeed in this course. Participation in lab and
discussion determines your participation score for the course.</p>

<p>Sign up for a section <a href="http://links.cs61a.org/section-signup">using this form</a>.</p>


<h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>


<p>In office hours, you can ask questions about the material, receive guidance on
assignments, and work with peers and course staff in a small group setting. See
the <a href="../office-hours.html">office hour schedule</a> and come by; no appointments are
needed.</p>


<h3 id="group-mentoring-sections">Group Mentoring Sections</h3>


<p>Optional group mentoring sections are held each week, starting the week after
midterm 1. Each section features worksheets that review topics from the course.
These sections of at most 5 or 6 students meet weekly and exist to create a
stronger feeling of community in the class and reinforce conceptual
understanding of course material. These will be recurring sections which will
have the same group of students, and sign-ups for these sections will open after
the first midterm.</p>


<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>


<p>Each week, there will be problems assigned for you to work on, most of which
will involve writing and analyzing programs. These assignments come in three
categories: lab exercises, homework assignments, and projects.</p>


<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>


<p>Lab exercises are designed to introduce a new topic. You can complete and submit
these during the scheduled lab sections, or on your own time before the
scheduled due date. Most students find that attending lab is much more useful
than working on lab assignments independently.</p>

<p><strong>Lab exercises</strong> are scored on correct completion. To receive credit, you must
complete all of the problems that are not marked as optional and pass all tests.</p>

<p>We expect for there to be 14 lab exercises, of which 11 will be scored.
Completing lab exercises on time contributes toward your <a href="about.html#lab-and-discussion-participation">participation
score</a>.</p>


<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>


<p>Homeworks are weekly assignments meant to help you apply the concepts learned
in lecture and section on more challenging problems. They will usually be
released on Friday night and be due the following Thursday night.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to discuss the homework with other students, as long as you
write your own code and submit your own work. Finding a study group is a great
idea. The purpose of homework is for you to learn the course material, not to
prove that you already know it. Therefore, you can expect to receive
substantial assistance from the course staff and your grade will ultimately be
based on showing effort on every problem, even if you don't pass all the tests.</p>

<p>Reasonable effort on the homework involves, at minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing code for each problem.</li>
  <li>Answering some questions correctly.</li>
  <li>For the questions not answered correctly, describe what you did try and where
  you got stuck.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are responsible for writing solutions yourself. <strong>If you are stuck on a
problem, come get help instead of copying the answer from someone else or the
Internet; you'll still get credit and won't be flagged for cheating.</strong></p>


<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>


<p>Projects are larger assignments intended to combine ideas from the course in
interesting ways. Some projects can be completed in pairs. When working in
pairs, you should work together to ensure that both of you understand the
complete results. We recommend finding a project partner in your section. Your
TA will help if you ask. You may also work alone on all projects, although
partners are recommended for the paired projects. Projects are graded on both
correctness and <a href="composition.html">composition</a>.</p>


<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>


<p>Midterm 1 will be held 7pm-9pm Monday, September 16. You are permitted to bring
one double-sided, letter-sized, handwritten sheets of notes.</p>

<p>Midterm 2 will be held 8pm-10pm Thursday, October 24. You are permitted to bring
two double-sided, letter-sized, handwritten sheets of notes. One of them can be
your notes from Midterm 1.</p>

<blockquote><p>Students who have a course conflict with a midterm should notify the staff
<em>before</em> the exam in question, and special arrangements will be made. Details
of how to report an exam conflict will be announced shortly.</p></blockquote>

<p>The final exam will be held 3pm-6pm Thursday, December 19. You are permitted to
bring three double-sided, letter-sized, handwritten sheets of notes. Two of them
can be your notes from Midterm 2.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you have a direct conflict with another final exam, we will allow you to
take an alternate final 7pm-10pm on Thursday, December 19. We will not provide
final alternates for any other reason.</p></blockquote>


<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>



<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>


<p>The online textbook for the course is <a href="http://composingprograms.com/">Composing
Programs</a>, which was created specifically for
this course, based on the classic textbook <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs</a>.
Readings for each lecture appear in the course schedule. We recommend that you
complete the readings before attending lecture.</p>


<h3 id="computing-resources">Computing Resources</h3>


<p>If you are enrolled in the class, you may request a CS 61A instructional
account. This account will allow you to use any EECS instructional lab computer
in Soda or Cory Hall. You may use any lab you wish, as long as there is no class
using the space.</p>

<p>Labs are normally available for use at all times, but you need a card key for
evening access. If you are a Berkeley student, your student ID will
automatically grant you access to the Soda second floor labs. Otherwise, you
can fill out an application from 387 Soda (the front desk).</p>

<p>Be respectful of the lab space. Please don't steal the chairs, and definitely
do not eat or drink in the lab. Don't unplug anything; unplugged computers make
our hard-working instructional computing team very sad. If you see someone
disrupting the space, ask them to stop.</p>


<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>


<p>Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 300 points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Midterm 1, worth 40 points.</li>
  <li>Midterm 2, worth 50 points.</li>
  <li>The final exam, worth 75 points.</li>
  <li>Four projects, worth 100 points.</li>
  <li>Homework, worth 25 points.</li>
  <li>Section participation, worth 10 points.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a handful extra credit points available throughout the semester,
perhaps around 10, that are available to everyone.</p>

<p>Each letter grade for the course corresponds to a range of scores:</p>

<pre><code>A+  ≥ 300    A  ≥ 285    A&#x2d;  ≥ 270
B+  ≥ 250    B  ≥ 225    B&#x2d;  ≥ 205
C+  ≥ 195    C  ≥ 185    C&#x2d;  ≥ 175
D+  ≥ 170    D  ≥ 165    D&#x2d;  ≥ 160</code></pre>

<p>Your final score will be rounded to the nearest integer before being converted
to a letter grade. 0.5 rounds up to 1, but 0.49 rounds down to 0.</p>

<p>There is no curve; your grade will depend only on how well you do, and not on
how well everyone else does. Score thresholds are based on how students
performed in previous semesters. It is possible that the instructors will adjust
the thresholds in your favor, for example if exam scores are abnormally low, but
we try to avoid that scenario. If all goes according to plan, then these are the
exact thresholds that will be used at the end of the course to assign grades
(contrary to popular rumor). In a typical semester, about 60% of students taking
the course for a letter grade will receive a B+ or higher.</p>

<p>Incomplete grades will be granted only for medical or personal emergencies that
cause you to miss the final or last part of the course, only for students who
have completed the majority of the coursework, and only if work up to the point
of the emergency has been satisfactory.</p>


<h3 id="lab-and-discussion-participation">Lab and Discussion Participation</h3>


<p>The participation score is designed to make sure that all students attend at
least the first few weeks of lab and discussion sections to try them out.
Continuing to attend provides a safety net in case of a low midterm score.</p>

<p>Attending a discussion or submitting a scored lab will earn you one
participation credit. There will be about 23 possible credits available (12
discussions after the first and 11 scored labs).</p>

<p>To earn a perfect participation score in the course, you need to earn at least
10 credits.  Your course section participation score is the number of
participation credits you earn over the semester, up to 10.</p>

<p>Additional participation credits beyond the first 10 contribute to recovery
points on midterms. Earning 20 or more participation credits will give you the
maximum amount of midterm recovery.</p>

<p>We calculate your midterm recovery using the following logic, where
<code>participation</code> is the number of participation credits you earn:</p>

<pre><code>def exam_recovery(your_exam_score, participation, max_exam_score, cap=20):
    half_score = max_exam_score / 2
    max_recovery = max(0, (half_score &#x2d; your_exam_score) / 2)
    recovery_ratio = min(participation, cap) / cap
    return max_recovery * recovery_ratio</code></pre>

<p>According to this formula, if you receive more than half the available points on
each midterm, then you don't recover any points. If you score just below half the
points, you will recover a few points. If you score far below half the points,
you will recover many points. The more recovery credits you earn, the more exam
points will be recovered.</p>

<p>Additionally, what matters for exam recovery is the percentage of the total participation
credits you receive, not the absolute number of participation credits.</p>

<p>The purpose of this policy is to ensure that students who continue to invest
time in the course througout the semester are able to pass.</p>

<p>There are no recovery points available on the final exam.</p>

<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>


<p>If you cannot turn in an assignment on time, contact your TA and partner as
early as possible. Depending on the circumstance, we may grant extensions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Labs</strong>: We very rarely accept late lab submissions. There is no partial credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Homework</strong>: We very rarely accept late homework submissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong>: Submissions within 24 hours after the deadline will receive
  75% of the earned score. Submissions that are 24 hours or more after the
  deadline will receive 0 points.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="learning-cooperatively">Learning Cooperatively</h2>


<p>With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss course
activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You
will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do
not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.</p>

<p>Learning cooperatively is different from sharing answers. You shouldn't be
showing your code to other students, except to your project partner or to
someone who has already submitted the assignment and is helping you finish. If
you are helping another student, don't just tell them the answer; they will
learn very little and run into trouble on exams. Instead, try to guide them
toward discovering the solution on their own. Problem solving practice is the
key to progress in computer science.</p>

<p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and TA
informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course
for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason,
please don't just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner,
so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can't finish.</p>


<h3 id="online-forum">Online Forum</h3>


<p>If you have any questions, please post them to
<a href="http://www.piazza.com/berkeley/summer2019/cs61a">Piazza</a>, the course discussion
forum. Piazza allows you to learn from questions your fellow students have
asked. We encourage you to answer each others' questions!</p>

<p>Piazza is the best and most reliable way to contact the course staff. You are
also welcome to email cs61a+fa19@berkeley.edu, denero@berkeley.edu, or your TA
directly.</p>


<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>


<p>Cooperation has a limit, and in CS 61A that limit is sharing code. You are free
to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but you must write your own
solutions. The only student with whom you can share code is your project
partner.</p>

<p>If you are unsure if what you are doing is cheating, please clarify with the
instructor or TAs. The following is a list of things you should NOT do. This
list is not exhaustive, but covers most of the big offenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not copy code from any student who is not your partner.</li>
  <li>Do not allow any student other than your partner to copy code from you.</li>
  <li>Do not copy solutions from online sources such as Stack Overflow, Pastebin,
  and public repositories on GitHub.</li>
  <li>Do not post your solutions publicly during or after the semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find a solution online, please <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/nL2yOj1Z81HcQYDi2">submit a link to that solution
anonymously</a>. When we find an online
solution, we ask the author to remove it. We also record the solution and use it
to check for copying. By reporting online solutions, you help keep the course
fair for everyone.</p>

<p>In summary, we expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and
complete your own projects. The assignments and evaluations are structured to
help you learn, which is why you are here. The course staff works hard to put
together this course, and we ask in return that you respect the integrity of
the course by not misrepresenting your work.</p>

<p>Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in
this course! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the
time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy
any answers.</p>

<p>Grades and penalties aren't the purpose of this course. We really just want you
to learn. The entire staff is very excited to be teaching CS 61A this semester
and we're looking forward to meeting such a large and enthusiastic group of
students. We want all of you to be successful here. Welcome to CS 61A!</p>
