<h2 id="a-introduction">A. Introduction</h2>


<p>Welcome to CS 61B.
The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with
particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer's point
of view.  CS 61A covered high-level approaches to problem-solving,
providing you with a variety of ways to organize solutions to
programming problems as compositions of functions, collections of
objects, or sets of rules. In CS 61B, we move to a somewhat more
detailed (and to some extent, more basic) level of programming.</p>

<p>As
in 61A, the <em>correctness</em> of a program is important. In CS 61B,
we're concerned also with <em>engineering</em>. An engineer, it is
said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar.
Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in
time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data.  We'll
also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to
build and maintain moderately large programs.</p>


<h2 id="b-background-knowledge">B. Background Knowledge</h2>


<p>This class assumes you have taken CS61A or E7, or have
equivalent background to a student who has taken one of these courses.
The course is largely built upon the assumption that you have taken
CS61A and E7 students may find the beginning of the course
to be a bit scarier, particularly when it comes to object-oriented
programming.</p>

<p>We assume you are coming in with zero Java experience. Nonetheless, we
will move through basic Java syntax quickly.
Some of you may have thought that the stuff you learned in CS 61A was mere
esoteric fluff inexplicably thrown at you to weed out the faint of
heart.  Not true.  In fact, although the syntaxes of Java, Python, and Scheme
are enormously different, the underlying computational models are
surprisingly similar.  You will find that almost all the "big ideas"
you see in Java had their analogues in what you learned in CS 61A
(indeed, one self-test of your understanding of the course material in
CS 61B is to check that you see all the similarities).</p>

<p>If you already have Java experience, great! We hope that you'll help
out your fellow students in discussion, lab, and on Piazza,
particularly in the opening weeks when everyone is catching up on
Java.</p>

<p>It would be nice, though not absolutely necessary, to have some UNIX
experience before the semester starts.  All the instructional machines
for this course will be running various flavors of the UNIX operating
system (generally, Ubuntu) and it's a really good idea for you to
become familiar with it. There will be online resources for learning
Unix linked from the first lab. We will also announce on-campus help
sessions on the announcements section of this website. If you'd like a
physical reference, you might try
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Command-Shell-Scripting-Bible/dp/111898384X/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1472433651&sr=8-13&keywords=unix">Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible</a> by Richard Blum and
Christine Breshnahan, which is fairly recent and positively reviewed.
You'll find several other books on the topic on Amazon.</p>


<h2 id="c-is-this-the-right-course-for-me">C. Is This the Right Course for Me?</h2>


<p>This is a course about data structures and programming methods. It
happens to also teach Java, since it is hard to teach programming
without a language. However, it is not intended as an exhaustive
course on Java, the World-Wide Web, creating applets, user interfaces,
graphics, or any of that fun stuff.</p>

<p>Some of you may have already had a data structures course, and simply
want to learn Java or C++. For you, self-study may be a better option.
A little web searching will turn up various resourses for learning new
programming languages.</p>

<p>Finally, the 1-unit self-paced course CS 47B is for students "with
sufficient partial credit in 61B," allowing them (with instructor's
permission) to complete the 61B course requirement without taking the
full course.  Mail to cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu for the necessary permission,
sending a description of your previous courses with detailed descriptions of
course projects (or links to this information).</p>


<h2 id="d-discussion-and-lab-sections">D. Discussion and Lab Sections</h2>


<p>Each week there is a 1-hour discussion section and a 2-hour lab
section headed by a GSI and supported by volunteer academic interns.
You can find information about the staff running each section on the
<a href="staff.html">staff page</a>.</p>

<p>If you decide to permanently switch sections, please clear it with the
two TAs involved.</p>

<p>Attendance is optional but highly recommended for discussions and labs.
Also, labs are a time during which you have
access to TAs and academic interns to answer questions and help you over various
conceptual hurdles.  In general, lab submissions are due at midnight on Friday,
although it would be best to complete them during (or before) the lab.</p>

<p>Labs will be online, so you will be able to do much of the work ahead
of time. Nonetheless, we encourage you to attend your scheduled lab
time.  One major purpose of the labs is to give your TA a chance to
check up on you and to find out what people are and are not
understanding. We've found that with the increasing ability to work
anywhere has come an increasing tendency for students to go off by
themselves and fall behind. Don't make this mistake. Keep up with
homework and lab work and above all <em>let us know when you don't
understand something!</em></p>

<p>The <a href="index.html">course home page</a> will provide one-stop shopping for
course information.  The course schedule as well as all handouts,
homework, labs, FAQs, etc., will be posted there.</p>

<p>Our discussion forum this semester will be <a href="https://piazza.com/class/k5eevxebzpj25b">Piazza</a>. For most
questions about the course, Piazza is the right place to ask them. The
course staff read it regularly, so you will get a quick answer.
Furthermore, by posting online as opposed to emailing us directly,
other students benefit by seeing the question and the answer. Don't
forget to check Piazza before asking your question, just in case
someone else has already posted it.  Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> use Piazza for
problems specific to you (wrong scores, personal issues, etc.); use e-mail.</p>

<p>The e-mail address
<a href="mailto:cs61b@berkeley.edu">cs61b@berkeley.edu</a>
will send a message to the course staff (PNH and the TAs). You can
use it for correspondence that you don't want to send to Piazza. We
all read it, so you will usually get a quick reply. If you send a
question that is of general interest, we may post the response on
Piazza (we will keep personal information out of it, of course).</p>

<p>To talk with us, the best way is to come during regular office hours
(posted on the home page). The second best option is to stop by an idle
lab. Many of us are available at other times by appointment.  Please
don't be shy. Web pages, email, and Piazza are useful, but it's still
much easier to understand something when you can talk about it face-to-face.</p>


<h2 id="e-course-materials">E. Course Materials</h2>


<p>The optional textbook for the first seven weeks of this course is
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=head+first+java&oq=head+first+java&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.870j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-
8"><em>Head First Java, 2nd Edition by
Sierra</em></a> and Bates (O'Reilly, 2005). This book is recommended to those of
you with no Java experience. It's an easy read and super cheap for a
textbook.
There are also some <a href="materials/book1/java.pdf">on-line notes about Java</a> from which we'll assign
some readings.</p>

<p>For the second part of the course, we'll use another set of
<a href="materials/book2/data-structures.pdf">on-line notes about data structures</a>.  There are numerous other
sources you may find useful, notably
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=algorithms+4th+edition&oq=algorithms+4th+edition&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61l3.1950j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a>.</p>

<p>Both textbooks for this course are optional. Homework will not be assigned from them, and alternative readings will be provided when possible.</p>

<p>Head First Java is not a reference book (it says so on page xxii). The
official description of the Java core language is available online in
[The Java Language Specification]<a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/Java&#32;SE&#32;8&#32;Edition"></a> by James Gosling,
Bill Joy, Guy Steele, Gilad Bracha,
and Alex Buckley. It's extremely thorough and easy to read (once you
understand how to read it).</p>


<h2 id="f-software">F. Software</h2>


<p>This course does not have an official text editor. You may use Vim,
Emacs, Sublime, or IDEs like Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ, Sublime,
etc. Whatever you use, however, your submitted solutions must conform
to our expected layouts, as indicated in the assignments. 
We will not officially support any IDE other than IntelliJ.</p>

<p>This semester, the instructional machines will be using Java 13.
It is already installed on the
lab computers, and it may be provided with your computer as well.
For your own personal use on your home setup,
Java 11 should be fine (it's a "Long Term Support"
or LTS version, with free updates through September 2022).</p>

<p>You will be able to do any work you'd like on any Windows, Mac OS X,
or Linux setup. You may also remotely log into the instructional
machines (for which you should get an account during the first
week), though you should be able to do most everything in the course by
working natively on your own computer. Information for setting up your
own computer is linked in <a href="materials/lab/lab1/index.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>We'll be using the version-control system <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for keeping and
tracking your work.  Version-control systems allow you maintain a
series of "snapshots" of your files at various points in their
development. Used properly, this provides you some back-up protection,
so that you can recover previous states of your work when something
goes wrong.  Also for team-oriented projects (as well as in the real
world), version-control systems help manage collaborative work.</p>

<p>You will be learning and using Git for this course to track your work.
This will allow the staff to track your progress in the course. The
first lab will teach you the basics of what you will need to know.
Feel free to also read <a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">Git documentation</a>.</p>


<h2 id="g-homeworks-and-labs">G. Homeworks and Labs</h2>


<p>There will be weekly labs and about half as many homeworks.
Labs will take approximately
two hours to complete, though some may run slightly longer. HWs will
vary from 3 to 10 hours of work. You will turn in everything
electronically using Git. All homeworks are individual
efforts (without partners) while partners are highly encouraged for labs.</p>

<p>Homework will be given full credit for passing a substantial proportion
of a suite of correctness tests while
labs will receive full credit for showing "reasonable effort."
Passing all of our autograder
tests for homework will ensure full credit.</p>

<p>No extensions or grace hours will be granted for labs or homework
except in cases of emergency (with require instructor approval). To
allow for situations that may arise in the course of life, the lowest
one homework assignment will be dropped and the two lowest labs will
be dropped.</p>


<h2 id="h-programming-projects">H. Programming Projects</h2>


<p>There will be three larger programming projects (and a warm-up "miniproject").
The projects will be
individual efforts, with the same collaboration rules as HW. You'll
have later classes that will provide more opportunities to build your
teamwork skills. For 61B, our goal is to help you build the
independence and fundamental skills that you'll need to thrive when
building large programs.</p>

<p>Projects will have some other tests that we will
not report to you. Thus, passing all <code>make check</code> tests
will not necessarily guarantee receiving full points on the
autograded portion of the project. This is intended to encourage you
to write your own tests to provide a more complete test suite.</p>

<p>Miniproject 0 and projects 1, 2, and 3 will be worth 16, 28, 28, and 28 points
respectively. There may be extra credit opportunities on some
projects.</p>


<h2 id="testing-environment">Testing Environment</h2>

<p>For all submitted assignments (projects, homeworks, labs),
we run the autograder <strong><em>on the instructional machines.</em></strong>  The fact that
your assignment runs at home is <strong>not</strong> sufficient; it must run on our setup.
This only mirrors the real world: customers run software on the systems they
have, not on the specially augmented systems that developers might use to
create that software.  You can check your submission by logging into an
instructional server, and checking out and testing your submission on
your local repository there, using a command sequence such as</p>

<pre><code>  git fetch origin
  git checkout proj1&#x2d;2
  cd proj1
  make
  make style
  make check
  git checkout master   # To get back to the master branch.</code></pre>

<p>Also, you can check all results using the Scores tab on our web pages.</p>


<h2 id="i-exams">I. Exams</h2>


<p>There will be two evening tests on 2/27/2020 and 4/1/2020,
and a final exam on 5/13/2020. All tests are open book, open notes.
Officially, exams
may cover any material whatsoever. On the other hand, we are known to be
reasonable.</p>

<p>Inevitably, some of you will have conflicts with the scheduled exam
times for the first two tests. 
We will arrange for alternative test times for those people who
have sufficient cause.  Sufficient cause includes conflicting exams <strong><em>other than
finals</em></strong> for other courses, medical or family emergencies, and important
religious holidays.
We make no guarantees about resolving conflicts with the final.
Popular reasons that are <em>not</em> sufficient cause include having job
interviews, having a plane ticket that you (or your parents) bought
without consulting the schedule, having exams or assignments in other
courses at nearby times, being behind in your reading, being tired, or
being hung over.</p>

<p>We will provide a form before each exam for students to
request alternative exams, which will almost certainly occur after the
regular exam has occurred. With the obvious exception of emergencies,
you must fill out this form by the provided deadline to be considered
for an alternate exam.</p>


<h2 id="j-grades">J. Grades</h2>


<p>Your letter grade will be determined by the total points out of the
possible 200.  In other words, <em>there is no curve.</em> Your grade will
depend solely on how well you do, and not on how well everyone else
does.</p>

<p>We will grant grades of Incomplete <em>only</em> for dire medical or personal
emergencies that cause you to miss the final or a project,
and only if your work up to
that point has been satisfactory.  Do <em>not</em> try to get an
incomplete simply as a way to have more time to study or do a project.
That is contrary to University policy.</p>


<h2 id="k-policy-on-collaboration-and-cheating">K. Policy on Collaboration and Cheating</h2>


<p>Deadlines can be stressful, and we know that under extreme pressure,
it becomes tempting to start rationalizing actions that you would
otherwise yourself consider inappropriate. Perhaps you'll find
yourself facing a 61B project deadline, and under all this stress
you'll convince yourself that you're just going to cheat for the
moment so you can get the points, and that you'll come back later and
really learn the thing you were supposed to have learned in order to
restore your karmic balance (we've heard something along these lines a
few times).</p>

<p>This is a terrible idea. Obviously it's important to learn how to deal
with deadlines, but far more important than that, giving into this
sort of pressure under not-so-dire circumstances is going to do some
damage to your moral compass. Someday, when the consequences are
higher than potentially losing a 1/3rd of a letter grade, you may find
yourself committing dishonest acts at the cost of someone else's
livelihood or life.</p>


<h2 id="l-homework-and-lab-collaboration-policy">L. Homework and Lab Collaboration Policy</h2>


<p>In CS61B, we have three types of assignments: homeworks, labs, and
projects. The entire point of homeworks and labs is to learn. For
homeworks or labs, you should feel free to collaborate with others
however you choose, though keep in mind that greater independence is
likely to give you a better learning experience (as long as you aren't
totally stuck). <strong>Even though we will allow close collaborations on
HWs, your code should still be your own work!</strong> Identical or
near identical submissions will be treated as plagiarism. For labs,
you are permitted to have one partner whose code is allowed to look
identical to yours. This student must be identified in the partners.txt
file contained in each lab.</p>


<h2 id="m-project-collaboration-policy">M. Project Collaboration Policy</h2>


<p>By contrast, the projects were designed not just for learning
(particularly how to be self-reliant in the context of large
unfamiliar systems), but also for the dual purpose of evaluating of
your mastery of the course material. As such, they are intended to be
completed primarily on your own,
particularly when it comes to writing the actual code.</p>

<p><strong>For projects and exams, we will be absolutely unforgiving.</strong> Any
incident will result in a failing grade for the course, though
Berkeley will let you retake 61B next semester. All
incidents of cheating will be referred to the Office of Student
Conduct.</p>

<p>What constitutes cheating? <strong>The golden rule of academic dishonesty is
that you should not claim to be responsible for work that is not
yours.</strong></p>

<p>This is obviously open to some interpretation, and you'll be getting
some help from instructors, the internet, other students, and more
throughout the course. This is OK, and we hope that the class is an
open, welcoming, collaborative environment where we can help each
other build the highest possible understanding of the course material.</p>

<p>To help (but not entirely define) the bounds of acceptable behavior,
we have three important rules for projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>By You Alone</strong>: All project code that you submit (other than
  skeleton code) should be written by you alone, except for small snippets that
  solve tiny subproblems (examples in the Permitted section below).</li>
  <li><strong>Do Not Possess or Share Code</strong>: Before a project deadline, you
  should never be in possession of solution code that you (or your
  partner) did not write. You will be equally culpable if you distribute
  such code to other students or future students of 61B (within reason).
  DO NOT GIVE ANYONE YOUR CODE -- EVEN IF THEY ARE DESPERATELY ASKING.
  DO NOT POST SOLUTIONS TO PROJECTS ONLINE (on GitHub or anywhere else)!
  By the way, any public posting of code derived from our skeletons is a
  violation of copyright as well.
  If you're not sure what you're doing is OK, please ask.</li>
  <li><strong>Cite Your Sources</strong>: When you receive significant assistance on a
  project from someone else, you should cite that assistance somewhere
  in your source code. We leave it to you to decide what constitutes
  'significant'.</li>
</ul>

<p>For clarity, examples of specific activities are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Permitted</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discussion of approaches for solving a problem.</li>
  <li>Giving away or receiving significant conceptual ideas towards a
  problem solution. Such help should be cited as comments in your code.
  For the sake of other's learning experience, we ask that you try not
  to give away anything juicy, and instead try to lead people to such
  solutions.</li>
  <li>Discussion of specific syntax issues and bugs in your code.</li>
  <li>Using small snippets of code that you find online for solving tiny
  problems (e.g. googling "uppercase string java" may lead you to some
  sample code that you copy and paste into your solution). Such usages
  should be cited as comments in your hw, lab, and especially project
  code!</li>
</ul>

<p>Permitted with <strong>Extreme Caution</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Looking at someone else's project code to assist with debugging.
  Typing or dictating code into someone else's computer is a violation
  of the "By You Alone" rule.</li>
  <li>Looking at someone else's project code to understand a particular
  idea or part of a project. This is strongly discouraged due to the
  danger of plagiarism, but not absolutely forbidden. We are very
  serious about the "By You Alone" rule!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Absolutely Forbidden</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Possessing another student's project code in any form before a final
  deadline, be it electronic or on paper. This includes the situation
  where you're trying to help someone debug. Distributing such code is
  equally forbidden.</li>
  <li>Possessing project solution code that you did not write yourself
  (from online (e.g. GitHub), staff solution code found somewhere on a
  server it should not have been, etc.) before a final deadline.
  Distributing such code is equally forbidden.</li>
  <li>Posting solution code to any assignment in a public place (e.g. a
  public git repository, mediafire, etched into stones above the
  Mediterranean, etc). This applies even after the semester is over.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have cheating-detection software, and we will routinely
run this code to detect cheating. Every semester, we catch and
penalize a significant number of people. Do not be one of them. If you
find yourself at such a point of total desperation that cheating
begins to look attractive, contact one of the instructors and we can
maybe help somehow. Likewise, if 61B is causing massive disruption to
your personal life, please contact us directly.</p>

<p>If you admit guilt to an act of plagiarism before we catch you, you
will be given zero points, and we will not refer your case to the
university administration.</p>

<p>Obviously, the expressive power of Java is a subset of the English
language. And yes, you can obviously obey the letter of this entire
policy while completely violating its spirit. However, this policy is
not a game to be defeated, and such circumventions will be seen as

<p>We will give no credit for homeworks or labs after the deadline. Your
lowest homework score and two lowest lab scores will be dropped. This
is intended to handle any contingencies. We do not normally give extensions
on homeworks or labs, other than for DSP students.</p>

<p>DSP students should
be aware that <strong><em>their allowances for extensions on assignments are not intended
to be used routinely.</em></strong>  We assume that most DSP students will <strong><em>not</em></strong> need
such extensions; they are intended for those individuals whose disability
tends to flare up from time to time.</p>

<p>On programming projects, we are a tad more lenient. For the first 24 hours,
we will deduct 5/24 percent of the maximum score (not including extra credit)
for each hour it is late, rounded off in some
unspecified fashion. After that, the penalty rises to 5/12 percent for
each additional hour late.  This means that you will lose roughly 5% of the
points for a project for the first day late and 10% for each subsequent day
(though tracking is by hours late, not days).  We will not accept projects
submitted more than 72 hours late. 
This semester, there will be
no unpenalized ("slip") hours for lateness, in contrast to past semesters.</p>

<p>We have changed these policies from previous years for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lenient late policies tended to encourage people to put off working on
  projects until it was too late to finish them in time.</li>
  <li>The habit of assuming that deadlines are optional is probably not a good one
  to carry into the "real world."</li>
  <li>Students would work on a project for many days after the deadline, falling
  farther behind on other work, when the wiser course would have been to
  hand in what they had and cut their losses.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a good reason for needing an extension, use the Scores tab
on the course web page to request one.  Do this <em>before
the day of the deadline</em>.
This goes for all students, including DSP students.  We can
forgive certain cases, such lying comatose in a hospital bed as a result of a
traffic accident, but generally you will be able to anticipate a problem and
tell us. Again, getting in front of problems promptly is a good habit for
later life.  In general, the maximum extension is 3 days,
<em>even for DSP students.</em>
<br/>

It is entirely your responsibility to make sure your assignments are
submitted correctly and on time.
We do not accept explanations such as "I'm sure I
submitted it, but it just didn't show up."  Generally, that means that you did
not commit your work, or did not push your work, or otherwise did not follow
the directions for how to submit your work.  Another all-too-common
occurrence is that students believe they have submitted their
solutions, but have actually submitted a copy of the skeleton code instead.
Again, this is the result of not following instructions at some point.  If
you look around, you'll see that we've provided the means to check
exactly what you've submitted; if you choose not to use them, you must
bear the consequences.</p>
