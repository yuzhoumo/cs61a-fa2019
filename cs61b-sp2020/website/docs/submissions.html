<h2 id="a-submitting-your-work">A. Submitting Your Work</h2>


<p>To submit an assignment (e.g., proj1), just tag it in your local repository
and push the tags, using the assignment name suffixed by <em>-N</em> as the tag, for
<em>N</em> a unique integer (e.g., proj1-1).  The entire procedure is</p>

<pre><code>    $ git status    # Check that you have committed all desired files.
                    # Use &#x27;git add&#x27; and &#x27;git commit &#x2d;a&#x27; if not.
    $ git tag proj1&#x2d;1   # Example of creating a tag.
    $ git push
    $ git push &#x2d;&#x2d;tags</code></pre>

<p>You should see a message including (for this example):</p>

<pre><code>    remote: *** Assignment proj1 submitted.</code></pre>

<p>If you do not see this line, <strong><em>YOU HAVE NOT SUBMITTED YOUR WORK!!!</em></strong></p>

<p>If you have already made several submissions (e.g., proj1-1, proj2-2) and
wish instead to resubmit a previous submission (e.g., proj1-1) in place of
the latest one, simply choose still another new tag and make it label the same
commit as the previous tag you wish to substitute:</p>

<pre><code>    $ git tag proj1&#x2d;3 proj1&#x2d;1
    $ git push &#x2d;&#x2d;tags</code></pre>


<h2 id="b-submission-times">B. Submission Times</h2>


<p>Tags refer to commits (they're sort of like pointers in this respect), and the
time of a submission is taken to be the time at which the tagged commit
was created, and <em>not</em> the time the tag was created.  Thus, the trick at the
end of <a href="submissions.html#a-submitting-your-work">section A</a> will cause proj1-3 to have the same
time as proj1-1.</p>

<p>This is true in general.  If you forget to tag and submit an on-time
commit altogether, you can remedy the situtation without being penalized for
lateness <em>assuming</em> you have committed the desired work.  First, find the
commit you want with</p>

<pre><code>    $ git log</code></pre>

<p>Each entry in the log shows a commit, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    commit 3e0c1b12e7d4327d91aa6fb5a18d49e0001afd5c
    Author: Random Student &lt;random42@berkeley.edu&gt;
    Date:   Sun Oct 9 16:30:57 2016 &#x2d;0700

        Working version of proj1.</code></pre>

<p>Create a tag for it like this:</p>

<pre><code>    $ git tag proj1&#x2d;4 3e0c1b12</code></pre>

<p>(you only need enough of the commit id to distinguish it from all others).
Submit as usual:</p>

<pre><code>    $ git push &#x2d;&#x2d;tags</code></pre>

<p>You can first check that this commit is what you want by checking it out:</p>

<pre><code>    $ git checkout 3e0c1b12</code></pre>

<p>After satisfying yourself that this commit is what you intended, be sure
to return to your normal branch with</p>

<pre><code>    $ git checkout master</code></pre>

<p>(Otherwise, you will be in "detached HEAD state" and any further committing
and pushing is likely to cause grief.)</p>


<h2 id="c-reading-the-glookup-results-page">C. Reading the Glookup Results Page</h2>


<p>The "Scores" tab on the website produces the "Glookup Results" page.  The
first section (Scores) shows any grades that have been entered for assignments
whose due date is past.  An entry of the form "---/..." indicates an
assignment that is not yet graded or for which we have received no submission.</p>

<p>The second section (Electronic submissions received)
lists the assignments for which we have received submissions (the ones you have
committed, pushed, tagged, and pushed tags.)</p>

<p>Click on an assignment to see the details of submissions we've received.
Generally, these will show a tag of the form <code>submit/proj1&#x2d;1</code> in the
<strong>Tag</strong> column.  The <code>submit/...</code> tags are internally generated by our software;
you'll see them in your local repository when you fetch or pull from the
central repository, but you should not try to create any tags of that form
yourself.  These tags are numbered sequentially in the order the central
repository receives new tags from you; the numbers generally bear no
relationship to the numbers you chose.  The <strong>Commit Date</strong> column shows the
time at which the tagged commit was created, not the time at which you tagged
or pushed that commit. The <strong>Grading Logs</strong> column shows any results from
our autograder (if we have one running for that assignment).  You can click
on the "[Log]" entries to see the output from the autograder.  Finally,
the <strong>Notes</strong> column indicates when a commit is late or whether one tag
labels the same commit as another.</p>

<p>The "[Log]" entries may change if we modify and re-run the autograder tests.
However, we generally try to avoid this after the assignment deadline.</p>
